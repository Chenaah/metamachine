MetaMachine Basic Usage Example
This script demonstrates the basic usage of MetaMachine, a simulation framework
for modular robots designed for reinforcement learning and evolutionary robotics
research. It shows how to:
1. Create and configure an environment
2. Reset the environment
3. Run a simple control loop with actions
4. Monitor environment state and termination conditions
The example uses a basic quadruped configuration and applies a simple
sinusoidal control signal to demonstrate the environment's response.
