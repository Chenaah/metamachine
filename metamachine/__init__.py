MetaMachine - A Modular Robotic Simulation Framework
MetaMachine is a simulation framework for modular robots. It provides flexible
environments and tools for reinforcement learning research, evolutionary robotics
research, and development of adaptive robotic systems with modular morphologies.
Key modules:
- environments: Core simulation environments and components
- robot_factory: Robot design and morphology generation tools
- utils: Utility functions and helper classes
Example usage:
from metamachine.environments.configs.config_registry import ConfigRegistry
from metamachine.environments.env_sim import MetaMachine
cfg = ConfigRegistry.create_from_name("basic_quadruped")
env = MetaMachine(cfg)
